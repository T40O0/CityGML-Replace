# CityGML-Replace  
  
i-UR1.4 was revised to i-UR1.5 in September 2021. The URL has been changed accordingly.  
This simple tool updates the old URLs described in the 3D city model (CityGML format) to the new URLs.
  
If you want to use the CityGML Importer for Autodesk, you will need to re-project using citygml-tools after replacing URLs.
